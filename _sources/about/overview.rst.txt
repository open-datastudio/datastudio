Overview
==================================

Open data studio is an open initiative to bring machine learning and large scale data processing open-source software to click away for everyone.

Why open data studio?
------------------------

The ability to use data becomes the key differentiator of businesses. 

To use data, we need tools. Thankfully, machine learning, data analytics, large scale data processing are the areas where open source software dominates. So many great tools are available to build your ML/data pipeline.

However, architecting, installing, integrating, and maintaining to build your pipeline became a new challenge, while it needs lots of investment to get proper setup/configurations, experiences, and best practices.
We know not every organization can not invest as much as those top few trillion-dollar value companies to build ML/data pipeline.

Open data studio's goal is to minimize this gap so any organization can have the
same ability from day one.
